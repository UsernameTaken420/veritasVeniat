Having had the chance to participate in Hackthebox's 2023 Cyber Apocalypse CTF event, I saw it fit to 
make a writeup for the challenges I managed to solve and explain the pitfalls encountered along the way.

Final list of solved challenges on my end was:
- [PWN] Initialise Connection
- [PWN] Questionnaire
- [PWN] Getting Started
- [Web] Trapped Source
- [Web] Gunhead
- [Web] Drobots
- [Web] Passman
- [Web] Orbital
- [Reversing] Shattered Tablet
- [Reversing] She Shells C Shells
- [Reversing] Needle in a Haystack
- [Misc] Persistence
- [Misc] Hijack
- [Misc] Restricted

- [ML] Reconfiguration
- [Forensics] Plaintext Treasure
- [Forensics] Alien Cradle
- [Forensics] Extraterrestrial Persistance
- [Forensics] Roten
- [Forensics] Packet Cyclone

Out of these, I'd like to highlight the ones that took the most mental effort.

## Shattered Tablet

> Deep in an ancient tomb, you've discovered a stone tablet with secret information on the locations of other relics. However, while dodging a poison dart, it slipped from your hands and shattered into hundreds of pieces. Can you reassemble it and read the clues?

chuuni shit huh
