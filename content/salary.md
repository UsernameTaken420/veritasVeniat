# But why tho

Decided to list my salary for every job and position I've held so far, [following in the footsteps of Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency) whose blog I've been following for a while.
On one hand, I could just take this as a scoreboard of "how well" it has been going for me so far. However, I hope this can also be of some help to others in the field so that they may make their case for a raise and not be exploited.

Or, in Xe's better worded words:
> By laying my hand out in the open like this, I hope to ensure that people are better informed about how much money they can make, so that they can be paid equally for equal work.

I've neglected to tag which were actual performance-based raises or inflation adjustment.
